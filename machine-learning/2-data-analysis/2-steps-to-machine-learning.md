## the steps to machine learning

* gathering data (knowledge acquired as experience)
* preparing data (according to the machine learning algorithm) (training data and testing data)
* choosing a model (to perform the task at hand in the best way possible)
* training the model (for the production of accurate values, so that mistakes ultimately lead to the right answers when the same problem comes along a second time) (the more training given, the more accurate the value)
* evaluation (test the values of the testing data on the model that has been trained to check the accuracy of the model)
* hyper-parameter tuning (visualization of the data to check the working of the model) (display data to make further changes/improvements)
* making the predictions (predict values)
