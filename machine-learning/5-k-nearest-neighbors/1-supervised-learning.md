## introduction to supervised learning

* type of system in which both input and desired output data are provided
* input and output data are labelled for classification to provide a learning basis for future data processing

## types of supervised learning

* classification: problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.
* regression: technique used to model and analyze the relationship between variables and often times how they contribute and are related to producing a particular outcome together.

## steps to machine learning

* gathering data
* preparing data
* choosing a model
* training
* evaluation
* hyper parameter tuning
* prediction

## gathering and preparation of data
* kaggle datasets
