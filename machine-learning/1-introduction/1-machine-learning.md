## introduction to machine learning
* learn from examples and experience without being explicitly programmed
* experience attained from the examples given to it
* data is fed into a generic algorithm and logic is built based on the input data

## the need for machine learning
* subset of artificial intelligence
* to build better and more intelligent machines
* machines are faster at processing and finding patterns in large and messy datasets

## types of machine learning
* supervised learning
* unsupervised learning
* reinforcement learning
