## supervised machine learning

* used by a majority of the machine learning applications
* system tries to learn from  previously-inputted examples
* teacher(data) - student(model) relationship
* the input and output results are entered, based on which a model is built to predict acurate output on new sets of unknown inputs
* characterized by the presence of the input variables (x) along with output variables (Y) and an algorithm to derive the mapping function Y = f(x)

## types of supervised learning
* classification : output in the form of a category or group that the inputs need to be sorted (or classified) into.
* regression : output variables in the form of real values.
