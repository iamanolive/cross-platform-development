## introduction to unsupervised learning

* the system attempts to find patterns directly from given examples.
* the algorithm is expected to find interesting patterns in the data all by itself.
* presence of input data only, with no corresponding output variable for the creation of a model.

## types of unsupervised learning

* association : the discovery of rules that describe large positions of given data
* clustering : the discovery of inherent groupings in data
