## supervised learning

* input and output data are provided, and the computer is supposed to create a model that takes in the input and is capable of producing the given output.
* input and output data are labelled for classification to provide a learning basis for future data processing.
* data is split into two parts: the training part and the testing part.

## categories of supervised learning

* classification: outputs a category/group
* regression: outputs a real/exact/pure value

## introduction to regression

* technique used to model and analyze the relationships between variables and how they contribute and are related to producing a particular outcome together
* creation of a straight line over data points to test the accuracy of the model created

## types of regression

* linear regression
* logistic regression
* polynomial regression
* ridge regression
* lasso regression
* elastic net regression

## introduction to linear regression

* a straight line is plotted based on the training data, and the distance between the point of testing data and the line determines how accurate the model is
* the closer the point to the line, the greater the accuracy of the model
* regression model that is made up completely of linear variables (y = mx + c => straight line equation)
